新的媒体格局

October 2024

Runway 不是一家 AI 公司。Runway 是一家媒体和娱乐公司。事实上，我认为 AI 公司的时代已经过去了。

这并不是因为 AI 失败了——恰恰相反。这是因为 AI 正在成为像电力或互联网一样的基础设施。如果今天称自己为 AI 公司，就如同在 2024 年自称是互联网公司一样毫无意义。这是因为 AI 已经普及。每家公司都在使用互联网；每家公司也将会使用 AI。

对于 Runway，我们的核心是艺术、媒体和广义的娱乐。大约七年前，我们创办了 Runway，怀抱着一个至今几乎未曾改变的愿景：AI 是讲故事的必要工具。为了实现这一愿景，我们倒推回去，打造了最优秀的研究团队，提供最优质的模型，进而构建最佳的产品。

我经常将我们的工作比作一种新型的相机。不是字面意义上的拍摄图像，而是其历史性的影响。相机不仅创造了摄影，还催生了整个行业、经济体和艺术形式。电影、电视、TikTok——都是那台捕捉光与时间的革命性工具的“后代”。

我认为我们在 Runway 所做的工作是为全新的媒体格局奠定基础。正如相机改变了我们捕捉现实的方式，AI 正在改变我们创造现实的方式。我们构建的模型和技术能力只是开始——它们就像那些最初的达盖尔银版照片，原始但充满可能性。很多人会犯下将 AI 视为终点的错误，但实际上它不是。AI 是机制，是成就更伟大事物的底层基础设施。真正的革命并不在于技术本身，而在于它所促成的事物：新的表达形式、新的叙事方式以及联系人的新方式。

媒体传统上就像是一条单行道。创作通过既定的渠道流向消费者。即使传播方式曾被颠覆——先有社交媒体，再有流媒体——基本模式仍然未变：有人创作，其他人消费。角色分明，界限清晰。然而，我们现在正见证一种不同的局面。想象一下观看一部随着你观看过程而自我生成的节目——真正动态的内容，它能够回应你，理解你，为你而创作。这就是通用模拟和世界构建。当内容能够在实时中自我塑造时，创作和分发的界限将消失。这便是全新媒体格局的基础所在。它关乎对媒体的根本性重新想象：互动的、生成式的、个性化的——同时也是共享的、普遍的。

这也是为什么纯粹的 AI 公司正逐渐变得过时。如今有趣的问题不再聚焦于技术本身，而是聚焦于我们如何用技术来建构新的内容。下一波创新浪潮将不会来自于专注于构建更好模型的公司。模型已经商品化，技术基础也已普遍确立并广为人知。无秘密可言。变革浪潮将由那些懂得如何利用这些工具来创造新形式的媒体、新型的体验和新的叙事方式的人引领。基础设施已经铺设，地基已经打好。现在到了最激动人心的部分：用它来创造有意义的内容。

AI 公司的结束标志着更有趣的事物的开始：真正的新媒体的诞生。这不仅仅是新的平台或格式，而是创造和体验内容的全新方式。我们不再是构建一家 AI 公司。而这才是一个更令人振奋的使命。就像一直以来那样，回归我们的初心。

**A New Media Landscape**  
  
_October 2024_  
  
Runway is not an AI company. Runway is a media and entertainment company. And I actually think the era of AI companies is over.  
  
It's not because AI failed - quite the opposite. It's because AI is becoming infrastructure, as fundamental as electricity or the internet. Calling yourself an AI company today is like calling yourself an internet company in 2024. It's meaningless because it's universal. Every company uses the internet; every company will use AI.  
  
For Runway, our focus is art, media, and entertainment at large. We began Runway almost seven years ago with [a vision that remains largely unchanged today](https://runwayml.com/news/machine-learning-en-plein-air-building-accessible-tools-for-artists): AI is a necessary tool for storytelling. To achieve that vision, we had to work backwards to build the best research team that could deliver the best models on which we could build the best products.  
  
I often talk about our work as a new kind of camera.[1](https://x.com/c_valenzuelab/status/1724598965897662483), [2](https://x.com/c_valenzuelab/status/1722323159616000154), [3](https://x.com/c_valenzuelab/status/1720068865239962107), [4](https://x.com/c_valenzuelab/status/1704289092115300678),  [5](https://x.com/c_valenzuelab/status/1666516134026448896) Not in the literal sense of capturing images, but in terms of its historical impact. The camera didn't just create photography - it birthed entire industries, economies, and art forms. Cinema, television, TikTok - all children of that first revolutionary tool that could capture light and time.  
  
I think the work we are doing at Runway is part of a new foundation for an entirely new media landscape. Just as the camera transformed how we capture reality, AI is transforming how we create it. The models and technical capabilities we've built are just the beginning - they're the equivalent of those first daguerreotypes, primitive yet pregnant with possibility. The mistake many make is seeing AI as the end goal. It's not. AI is the mechanism, the underlying infrastructure that enables something greater. The real revolution isn't in the technology itself but in what it enables: [new forms of expression](https://cvalenzuelab.com/gymforthemind), new ways of telling stories, new methods of connecting human experiences.  
  
Media has traditionally operated like a one-way street. Creation flows down established channels to reach consumers. Even when distribution was disrupted - first by social media, then by streaming - the fundamental pattern remained: someone creates, others consume. The roles were clear, the boundaries defined. But we're witnessing something different now. Imagine watching a show that generates itself as you watch it - truly dynamic content that responds to you, understands you, creates for you. [Universal Simulation](https://agermanidis.com/writings/universal-simulation/) and [world building](https://cvalenzuelab.com/worldbuilding). The distinction between creation and distribution dissolves when content can shape itself in real-time. That is the foundation for an entirely new media landscape. It's about fundamentally reimagining what media can be: interactive, generative, personal - yet simultaneously shared and universal.  
  
This is also why pure AI companies are becoming obsolete. The interesting questions aren't about the technology anymore - they're about what we build with it. The next wave of innovation won't come from companies focused on building better models. Models are commodities. The technical foundations are now well-established and known by everyone. There are no secrets. The wave of change will come from those who understand how to use these tools to create new forms of media, new types of experiences, new ways of telling stories. The infrastructure is laid. The foundation is built. Now comes the exciting part: creating something meaningful with it.  
  
The end of AI companies marks the beginning of something far more interesting: the birth of truly new media. Not just new platforms or formats, but entirely new ways of creating and experiencing content. We're not building an AI company anymore. And that's a far more exciting mission. Like it has always been; back to our roots.
